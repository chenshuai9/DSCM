%
% This file is the imperative program which is connects the dic 
% parts together. It has several sections, which are clearly indicated 
% in the code.
% 
% 1. Instruction messages and configuration input
% 2. Gridpoint definitions and user-based initial guess
% 3. Interpolation of both images
% 4. Optimize the initial guess using coarse fine search.
% 5. Prepare the output data structure.
% 6. Setup the priority queue and its dependencies.
% 7. The reliability-guided displacement tracking strategy. (see the report for more info on this)
%
% There are also two helper functions. approximateInitialGuess 
% approximates the initial guess of a new gridpoint by applying a correction 
% factor based on distance from its "parent" gridpoint. storeResult
% stores the results of IC-GN optimization in the output array.
%
% Input: dic()
% 
% Output:
% A 4x1 struct with the following fields, all 2d arrays:
% - result: one of DicConstants.RESULT_(OK | NO_CONVERGENCE | OUT_OF_BOUNDS)
% - coefficient: the correlation coefficient at that grid point
% - iterations: the number of needed iterations before convergence.
% - p: a 6x1 struct with the following fields: u, v, u_x, u_y, v_x, v_y
%
% The somewhat weird structure of the p field is because of memory 
% considerations. Matlab uses a lot of header data for every different 
% struct field, so adding separate p's would take a lot of memory 
% (width*height*headerData) instead of (6*headerData).
